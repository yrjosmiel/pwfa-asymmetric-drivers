Hello, git! This is my first time managing a GitHub repository, so expect some scuff!
Anyway, let's get started:
# About pwfa-asymmetric-drivers
This repo contains (well, *will contain*) everything needed to replicate the figures in my undergraduate thesis (and in the other derivative scientific works). These include:
* HiPACE++ input scripts
* Analysis and plotting scripts written in Python

Of course, using the input files requires the user to have HiPACE installed in their system.

# The physics
$n_0 = 3.11e16$ per cubic cm
Beam mean energy = 5.11 GeV (gamma = 10000)
