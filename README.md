Hello, git! This is my first time managing a GitHub repository, so expect some scuff!
Anyway, let's get started:
# About repositoriespwfa-asymmetric-drivers
This repo contains (well, *will contain*) everything needed to replicate the figures in my undergraduate thesis (and in the other derivative scientific works). These include:
* HiPACE++ input scripts
* Analysis and plotting scripts written in Python
Of course, using the input files requires the user to have HiPACE installed in their system.
